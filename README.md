# Pwned Password Checker

This Python script allows users to check whether their password has been exposed in known data breaches by leveraging the **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)** API. The script securely hashes the user's password using SHA-1, sends only the first five characters of the hash to the API, and retrieves a count of breaches associated with the password. This ensures maximum privacy and security while verifying the safety of passwords.
